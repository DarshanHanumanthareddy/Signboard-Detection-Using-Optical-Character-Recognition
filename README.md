# Signboard-Detection-Using-Optical-Character-Recognition


This project is based on text recognition scheme specifically designed for signboard detection. MSER and Multi-Scale Morphology segmentation techniques are used in conjunction to increase the chance of correctly determining the text bounding box. Calculated stroke width to filter non-text regions, Developed and performed OCR algorithm to detect characters using MATLAB.
